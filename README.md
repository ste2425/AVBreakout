This repo contains footprints and synbols in the `libraries` folder which can be re-used in projects.

The first footprint and symbol is for the TVOut connector used in AV cables so you can connect it to the PSP. 
When having this made select board thickness of 1.6mm.

There is also a footprint and symbol for the TVOut connector that is fitted to the PSP motherboard.

This allows for a breakout board and a AV cable to be used at the same time.

The project is this repo is just that, it breaks out the serial lines (with a logic level converter) and allows a AV cable to be used at the same time.
